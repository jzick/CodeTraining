Initial details.

Use this when want to go to new line for output, similar to HTML.
document.write("<br>");

Increment and detrement operators are a little confusing with the examples.
As well as x -= y being same as x = x - y

Need to understand the difference of being equal and identical for comparison operators

&& - True(both)
|| - True(one) - those called pipes I think
! - Opposite
Will need to find solution of how to keep opposites straight.

Helpful just to do a single space in output
document.write("\n")

Conditional (Ternary) Operator
var isAdult = (age < 18) ? "Too young": "Old enough";
 connect as many expressions as you wish.

Concatenate:
var mystring1 = "I am learning ";
var mystring2 = "JavaScript with SoloLearn.";
document.write(mystring1 + mystring2);

if / else:
var myNum1 = 7;
var myNum2 = 10;
if (myNum1 > myNum2) {
   alert("This is my first condition");
}
else {
   alert("This is my second condition");
}

Not sure yet how to do multiple conditions. Like if this do A, if this do B, else do C.

//else if works
var course = 3;
if (course == 1) {
    document.write("<h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>");
} else if (course == 2) {
    document.write("<h1>CSS Tutorial</h1>");
} else if (course == 3) {
    document.write("<h1>PHP Tutorial</h1>");
} else {
    document.write("<h1>JavaScript Tutorial</h1>");
}

Instead of doing else if, for multiple ones, can use switch statement.
var day = 2;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    document.write("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    document.write("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    document.write("Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    document.write("Another day");
}

// Outputs "Tuesday"

JavaScript has three types of loops: for, while, and do while. 
The for loop is commonly used when creating a loop.
The syntax:
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
   code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed before the loop (the code block) starts.
Statement 2 defines the condition for running the loop (the code block).
Statement 3 is executed each time after the loop (the code block) has been executed.
