Initial details.

Use this when want to go to new line for output, similar to HTML.
document.write("<br>");

Increment and detrement operators are a little confusing with the examples.
As well as x -= y being same as x = x - y

Need to understand the difference of being equal and identical for comparison operators

&& - True(both)
|| - True(one) - those called pipes I think
! - Opposite
Will need to find solution of how to keep opposites straight.

Helpful just to do a single space in output
document.write("\n")

Conditional (Ternary) Operator
var isAdult = (age < 18) ? "Too young": "Old enough";
 connect as many expressions as you wish.

Concatenate:
var mystring1 = "I am learning ";
var mystring2 = "JavaScript with SoloLearn.";
document.write(mystring1 + mystring2);

if / else:
var myNum1 = 7;
var myNum2 = 10;
if (myNum1 > myNum2) {
   alert("This is my first condition");
}
else {
   alert("This is my second condition");
}

Not sure yet how to do multiple conditions. Like if this do A, if this do B, else do C.

//else if works
var course = 3;
if (course == 1) {
    document.write("<h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>");
} else if (course == 2) {
    document.write("<h1>CSS Tutorial</h1>");
} else if (course == 3) {
    document.write("<h1>PHP Tutorial</h1>");
} else {
    document.write("<h1>JavaScript Tutorial</h1>");
}
